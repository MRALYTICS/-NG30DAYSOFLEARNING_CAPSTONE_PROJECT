 I Formatted the date to derive;
* the year(excel)

* the month(excel)

* Days of the week(excel0

* I deleted missing data, replaced the text with unknown and numbers with zero(powerbi)

* I deleted cn/in and registeration column

* I split the text to column BY delimeter as in the location column to derive the country
